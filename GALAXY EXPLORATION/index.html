The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. The observable Universe contains an estimated 1×1024 stars,[1][2] but most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.<div>For most of its active life, a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes.</div><div>Stars condense from regions of space of higher matter density, yet those regions are less dense than within a vacuum chamber. These regions—known as molecular clouds—consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium and a few percent heavier elements. One example of such a star-forming region is the Orion Nebula.[61] Most stars form in groups of dozens to hundreds of thousands of stars.[62] Massive stars in these groups may powerfully illuminate those clouds, ionizing the hydrogen, and creating H II regions. Such feedback effects, from star formation, may ultimately disrupt the cloud and prevent further star formation.</div><div><br></div><div>All stars spend the majority of their existence as main sequence stars, fueled primarily by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium within their cores. However, stars of different masses have markedly different properties at various stages of their development. The ultimate fate of more massive stars differs from that of less massive stars, as do their luminosities and the impact they have on their environment. Accordingly, astronomers often group stars by their mass:[63]</div><div><br></div><div>Very low mass stars, with masses below 0.5 M☉, are fully convective and distribute helium evenly throughout the whole star while on the main sequence. Therefore, they never undergo shell burning, never become red giants, which cease fusing and become helium white dwarfs and slowly cool after exhausting their hydrogen.[64] However, as the lifetime of 0.5 M☉ stars is longer than the age of the universe, no such star has yet reached the white dwarf stage.</div><div>Low mass stars (including the Sun), with a mass between 0.5 M☉ and 1.8–2.5 M☉ depending on composition, do become red giants as their core hydrogen is depleted and they begin to burn helium in core in a helium flash; they develop a degenerate carbon-oxygen core later on the asymptotic giant branch; they finally blow off their outer shell as a planetary nebula and leave behind their core in the form of a white dwarf.</div><div>Intermediate-mass stars, between 1.8–2.5 M☉ and 5–10 M☉, pass through evolutionary stages similar to low mass stars, but after a relatively short period on the red giant branch they ignite helium without a flash and spend an extended period in the red clump before forming a degenerate carbon-oxygen core.</div><div>Massive stars generally have a minimum mass of 7–10 M☉ (possibly as low as 5–6 M☉). After exhausting the hydrogen at the core these stars become supergiants and go on to fuse elements heavier than helium. They end their lives when their cores collapse and they explode as supernovae.</div></div><label style="margin: 0px; line-height: 1; overflow: hidden; overflow-wrap: break-word; max-width: 320px; border-style: solid; text-rendering: optimizespeed; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; padding: 2px 15px; width: 220px; height: 65px; position: absolute; left: 75px; top: 0px; font-size: 30px;" id="label3">STARS</label></div><div class="screen" tabindex="1" data-theme="default" id="subject2" style="height: 450px; width: 320px; left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute; z-index: 0; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: none;"><button id="button14" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-style: solid; height: 40px; width: 320px; background-color: rgb(6, 9, 253); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 4px; border-width: 1px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 410px; font-size: 30px;">next</button><div contenteditable="false" class="textArea" id="text_area3" style="width: 320px; height: 380px; border-style: solid; background-color: rgb(14, 14, 14); color: rgb(250, 251, 253); border-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-radius: 2px; border-width: 1px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 5px 15px; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 35px; margin: 0px; font-size: 20px;">A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.[b][1][2]<div><br></div><div>The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Apart from Earth itself, five planets in the Solar System are often visible to the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the current definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as planets under the current definition of planet.</div><div><br></div><div>The planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle motions. Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. About the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observational data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were elliptical rather than circular. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, each of the planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.</div></div><label style="margin: 0px; line-height: 1; overflow: hidden; overflow-wrap: break-word; max-width: 320px; border-style: solid; text-rendering: optimizespeed; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; padding: 2px 15px; width: 220px; height: 65px; position: absolute; left: 65px; top: 0px; font-size: 30px;" id="label4">PLANETS</label></div><div class="screen" tabindex="1" data-theme="default" id="subject3" style="height: 450px; width: 320px; left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute; z-index: 0; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: none;"><button id="button15" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-style: solid; height: 40px; width: 320px; background-color: rgb(241, 14, 30); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 4px; border-width: 1px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 410px; font-size: 30px;">next</button><div contenteditable="false" class="textArea" id="text_area4" style="width: 320px; height: 380px; border-style: solid; background-color: rgb(14, 14, 14); color: rgb(250, 251, 253); border-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-radius: 2px; border-width: 1px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 5px 15px; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 35px; margin: 0px; font-size: 20px;">Asteroids are minor planets, especially of the inner Solar System. Larger asteroids have also been called planetoids. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not resolve into a disc in a telescope and was not observed to have characteristics of an active comet such as a tail. As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered that were found to have volatile-rich surfaces similar to comets, these came to be distinguished from the objects found in the main asteroid belt.<div>Millions of asteroids exist, many the shattered remnants of planetesimals, bodies within the young Sun's solar nebula that never grew large enough to become planets.[2] The vast majority of known asteroids orbit within the main asteroid belt located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, or are co-orbital with Jupiter (the Jupiter trojans). However, other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the near-Earth objects. Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic spectra, with the majority falling into three main groups: C-type, M-type, and S-type. These were named after and are generally identified with carbon-rich, metallic, and silicate (stony) compositions, respectively. The sizes of asteroids varies greatly; the largest, Ceres, is almost 1,000 km (600 mi) across and massive enough to qualify as a dwarf planet.</div><div><br></div><div>Asteroids are somewhat arbitrarily differentiated from comets and meteoroids. In the case of comets, the difference is one of composition: while asteroids are mainly composed of mineral and rock, comets are primarily composed of dust and ice. Furthermore, asteroids formed closer to the sun, preventing the development of cometary ice.[3] The difference between asteroids and meteoroids is mainly one of size: meteoroids have a diameter of one meter or less, whereas asteroids have a diameter of greater than one meter.[4] Finally, meteoroids can be composed of either cometary or asteroidal materials.</div></div><label style="margin: 0px; line-height: 1; overflow: hidden; overflow-wrap: break-word; max-width: 320px; border-style: solid; text-rendering: optimizespeed; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; padding: 2px 15px; width: 240px; height: 65px; position: absolute; left: 40px; top: 0px; font-size: 30px;" id="label5">ASTEROIDS</label></div><div class="screen" tabindex="1" data-theme="default" id="subject4" style="height: 450px; width: 320px; left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute; z-index: 0; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: none;"><button id="button19" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-style: solid; height: 40px; width: 320px; background-color: rgb(236, 204, 13); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 4px; border-width: 1px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 410px; font-size: 30px;">next</button><div contenteditable="false" class="textArea" id="text_area5" style="width: 320px; height: 375px; border-style: solid; background-color: rgb(14, 14, 14); color: rgb(250, 251, 253); border-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-radius: 2px; border-width: 1px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 5px 15px; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 35px; margin: 0px; font-size: 20px;">A meteor, known colloquially as a shooting star or falling star, is the visible passage of a glowing meteoroid, micrometeoroid, comet or asteroid through Earth's atmosphere, after being heated to incandescence by collisions with air molecules in the upper atmosphere,[10][23][24] creating a streak of light via its rapid motion and sometimes also by shedding glowing material in its wake. Although a meteor may seem to be a few thousand feet from the Earth,[25] meteors typically occur in the mesosphere at altitudes from 76 to 100 km (250,000 to 330,000 ft).[26] The root word meteor comes from the Greek meteōros, meaning "high in the air".[23]<div><br></div><div>Millions of meteors occur in Earth's atmosphere daily. Most meteoroids that cause meteors are about the size of a grain of sand, i.e. they are usually millimeter-sized or smaller. Meteoroid sizes can be calculated from their mass and density which, in turn, can be estimated from the observed meteor trajectory in the upper atmosphere. [27] Meteors may occur in showers, which arise when Earth passes through a stream of debris left by a comet, or as "random" or "sporadic" meteors, not associated with a specific stream of space debris. A number of specific meteors have been observed, largely by members of the public and largely by accident, but with enough detail that orbits of the meteoroids producing the meteors have been calculated. The atmospheric velocities of meteors result from the movement of Earth around the Sun at about 30 km/s (67,000 mph),[28] the orbital speeds of meteoroids, and the gravity well of Earth.</div><div><br></div><div>Meteors become visible between about 75 to 120 km (250,000 to 390,000 ft) above Earth. They usually disintegrate at altitudes of 50 to 95 km (160,000 to 310,000 ft).[29] Meteors have roughly a fifty percent chance of a daylight (or near daylight) collision with Earth. Most meteors are, however, observed at night, when darkness allows fainter objects to be recognized. For bodies with a size scale larger than 10 cm (3.9 in) to several meters meteor visibility is due to the atmospheric ram pressure (not friction) that heats the meteoroid so that it glows and creates a shining trail of gases and melted meteoroid particles. The gases include vaporised meteoroid material and atmospheric gases that heat up when the meteoroid passes through the atmosphere. Most meteors glow for about a second.</div></div><label style="margin: 0px; line-height: 1; overflow: hidden; overflow-wrap: break-word; max-width: 320px; border-style: solid; text-rendering: optimizespeed; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; padding: 2px 15px; width: 220px; height: 65px; position: absolute; left: 55px; top: 0px; font-size: 30px;" id="label6">METEOR</label></div><div class="screen" tabindex="1" data-theme="default" id="screen1" style="height: 450px; width: 320px; left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute; z-index: 0; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: none;"><button id="button2" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-style: solid; height: 40px; width: 320px; background-color: rgb(4, 150, 226); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 4px; border-width: 1px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 410px; font-size: 30px;">back</button><div contenteditable="false" class="textArea" id="text_area1" style="width: 320px; height: 375px; border-style: solid; background-color: rgb(14, 14, 14); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-radius: 2px; border-width: 1px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 5px 15px; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 35px; margin: 0px; font-size: 20px;"> Near the end of its life, a star can also contain. degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.<div>A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. When the stellar core is sufficiently dense, hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through nuclear fusion, releasing energy in the process.[3] The remainder of the star's interior carries energy away from the core through a combination of radiative and convective heat transfer processes. The star's internal pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity. A star with mass greater than 0.4 times the Sun's will expand to become a red giant when the hydrogen fuel in its core is exhausted.[4] In some cases, it will fuse heavier elements at the core or in shells around the core. As the star expands it throws a part of its mass, enriched with those heavier elements, into the interstellar environment, to be recycled later as new stars.[5] Meanwhile, the core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or, if it is sufficiently massive, a black hole.</div><div>The formation of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density—often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy).[65][66] When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force</div><div>As the cloud collapses, individual conglomerations of dense dust and gas form "Bok globules". As a globule collapses and the density increases, the gravitational energy converts into heat and the temperature rises. When the protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition of hydrostatic equilibrium, a protostar forms at the core.[68] These pre-main-sequence stars are often surrounded by a protoplanetary disk and powered mainly by the conversion of gravitational energy. The period of gravitational contraction lasts about 10 to 15 million years.Early stars of less than 2 M☉ are called T Tauri stars, while those with greater mass are Herbig Ae/Be stars. These newly formed stars emit jets of gas along their axis of rotation, which may reduce the angular momentum of the collapsing star and result in small patches of nebulosity known as Herbig–Haro objects.[69][70] These jets, in combination with radiation from nearby massive stars, may help to drive away the surrounding cloud from which the star was formed.[71]</div><div><br></div><div>Early in their development, T Tauri stars follow the Hayashi track—they contract and decrease in luminosity while remaining at roughly the same temperature. Less massive T Tauri stars follow this track to the main sequence, while more massive stars turn onto the Henyey track.</div><div><br></div><div>Most stars are observed to be members of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed.[72] A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.</div></div><label style="margin: 0px; line-height: 1; overflow: hidden; overflow-wrap: break-word; max-width: 320px; border-style: solid; text-rendering: optimizespeed; color: rgb(10, 10, 10); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 0px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; padding: 2px 15px; width: 220px; height: 65px; position: absolute; left: 60px; top: 0px; font-size: 30px; border-width: 0px;" id="label1">STARS</label></div><div class="screen" tabindex="1" data-theme="default" id="screen2" style="height: 450px; width: 320px; left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute; z-index: 0; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: none;"><button id="button3" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-style: solid; height: 40px; width: 320px; background-color: rgb(4, 150, 226); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 4px; border-width: 1px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 410px; font-size: 30px;">back</button><div contenteditable="false" class="textArea" id="text_area7" style="width: 320px; height: 370px; border-style: solid; background-color: rgb(14, 14, 14); color: rgb(250, 251, 253); border-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-radius: 2px; border-width: 1px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 5px 15px; position: absolute; left: -1.66533e-16px; top: 40px; margin: 0px; font-size: 20px;">Planets in the Solar System are divided into two main types: large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials. There are eight planets in the Solar System.[1] In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Six of the planets are orbited by one or more natural satellites.<div><br></div><div>Several thousands of planets around other stars ("extrasolar planets" or "exoplanets") have been discovered in the Milky Way. As of 3 September 2020, 4,330 known extrasolar planets in 3,200 planetary systems (including 708 multiple planetary systems), ranging in size from just above the size of the Moon to gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter have been discovered, out of which more than 100 planets are the same size as Earth, nine of which are at the same relative distance from their star as Earth from the Sun, i.e. in the circumstellar habitable zone.[3][4] On December 20, 2011, the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets, Kepler-20e[5] and Kepler-20f,[6] orbiting a Sun-like star, Kepler-20.[7][8][9] A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data, estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way.[10] Around one in five Sun-like[c] stars is thought to have an Earth-sized[d] planet in its habitable[e] zone.[11][12]</div><div>21st century</div><div>With the discovery during the latter half of the 20th century of more objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a belt, or if it was large enough to generate energy by the thermonuclear fusion of deuterium.</div><div><br></div><div>A growing number of astronomers argued for Pluto to be declassified as a planet, because many similar objects approaching its size had been found in the same region of the Solar System (the Kuiper belt) during the 1990s and early 2000s. Pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands.</div><div><br></div><div>Some of them, such as Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris, were heralded in the popular press as the tenth planet, failing to receive widespread scientific recognition. The announcement of Eris in 2005, an object then thought of as 27% more massive than Pluto, created the necessity and public desire for an official definition of a planet.</div><div><br></div><div>Acknowledging the problem, the IAU set about creating the definition of planet, and produced one in August 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), and a new class of dwarf planets was created, initially containing three objects (Ceres, Pluto and Eris).[49]</div></div><label style="margin: 0px; line-height: 1; overflow: hidden; overflow-wrap: break-word; max-width: 320px; border-style: solid; text-rendering: optimizespeed; color: rgb(14, 0, 0); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; padding: 2px 15px; width: 220px; height: 65px; position: absolute; left: 65px; top: 5px; font-size: 30px;" id="label15">PLANETS</label></div><div class="screen" tabindex="1" data-theme="default" id="screen3" style="height: 450px; width: 320px; left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute; z-index: 0; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: none;"><button id="button4" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-style: solid; height: 40px; width: 320px; background-color: rgb(4, 150, 226); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 4px; border-width: 1px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 410px; font-size: 30px;">back</button><div contenteditable="false" class="textArea" id="text_area8" style="width: 320px; height: 380px; border-style: solid; background-color: rgb(14, 14, 14); color: rgb(250, 251, 253); border-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-radius: 2px; border-width: 1px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 5px 15px; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 35px; margin: 0px; font-size: 20px;">The first asteroid to be discovered, Ceres, was originally considered to be a new planet.[a] This was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies, which, with the equipment of the time, appeared to be points of light, like stars, showing little or no planetary disc, though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions. This prompted the astronomer Sir William Herschel to propose the term "asteroid",[b] coined in Greek as ἀστεροειδής, or asteroeidēs, meaning 'star-like, star-shaped', and derived from the Ancient Greek ἀστήρ astēr 'star, planet'. In the early second half of the nineteenth century, the terms "asteroid" and "planet" (not always qualified as "minor") were still used interchangeably.[c]<div><br></div><div>Discovery timeline:[23]</div><div><br></div><div>10 by 1849</div><div>1 Ceres, 1801</div><div>2 Pallas – 1802</div><div>3 Juno – 1804</div><div>4 Vesta – 1807</div><div>5 Astraea – 1845</div><div>6 Hebe – July 1847</div><div>7 Iris – August 1847</div><div>8 Flora – October 1847</div><div>9 Metis – 25 April 1848</div><div>10 Hygiea – 12 April 1849 tenth asteroid discovered</div><div>100 asteroids by 1868[23]</div><div>1,000 by 1921[23]</div><div>10,000 by 1989[23]</div><div>100,000 by 2005[25]</div><div>1,000,000 by 2020[7]</div><div>Asteroids vary greatly in size, from almost 1000 km for the largest down to rocks just 1 meter across.[f] The three largest are very much like miniature planets: they are roughly spherical, have at least partly differentiated interiors,[55] and are thought to be surviving protoplanets. The vast majority, however, are much smaller and are irregularly shaped; they are thought to be either battered planetesimals or fragments of larger bodies.</div><div><br></div><div>The dwarf planet Ceres is by far the largest asteroid, with a diameter of 940 km (580 mi). The next largest are 4 Vesta and 2 Pallas, both with diameters of just over 500 km (300 mi). Vesta is the only main-belt asteroid that can, on occasion, be visible to the naked eye. On some rare occasions, a near-Earth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid; see 99942 Apophis.</div><div><br></div><div>The mass of all the objects of the asteroid belt, lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, is estimated to be in the range of (2.8–3.2)×1021 kg, about 4% of the mass of the Moon. Of this, Ceres comprises 0.938×1021 kg, about a third of the total. Adding in the next three most massive objects, Vesta (9%), Pallas (7%), and Hygiea (3%), brings this figure up to half, whereas the three most-massive asteroids after that, 511 Davida (1.2%), 704 Interamnia (1.0%), and 52 Europa (0.9%), constitute only another 3%. The number of asteroids increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease.</div><div><br></div><div>The number of asteroids decreases markedly with size. Although this generally follows a power law, there are 'bumps' at 5 km and 100 km, where more asteroids than expected from a logarithmic distribution are found.</div></div><label style="margin: 0px; line-height: 1; overflow: hidden; overflow-wrap: break-word; max-width: 320px; border-style: solid; text-rendering: optimizespeed; color: rgb(12, 0, 0); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; padding: 2px 15px; width: 230px; height: 65px; position: absolute; left: 45px; top: 0px; font-size: 30px;" id="label16">ASTEROIDS</label></div><div class="screen" tabindex="1" data-theme="default" id="screen4" style="height: 450px; width: 320px; left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute; z-index: 0; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: none;"><button id="button6" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-style: solid; height: 40px; width: 320px; background-color: rgb(4, 150, 226); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 4px; border-width: 1px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 410px; font-size: 30px;">back</button><div contenteditable="false" class="textArea" id="text_area9" style="width: 320px; height: 380px; border-style: solid; background-color: rgb(14, 14, 14); color: rgb(250, 251, 253); border-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-radius: 2px; border-width: 1px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 5px 15px; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 30px; margin: 0px; font-size: 20px;">The entry of meteoroids into Earth's atmosphere produces three main effects: ionization of atmospheric molecules, dust that the meteoroid sheds, and the sound of passage. During the entry of a meteoroid or asteroid into the upper atmosphere, an ionization trail is created, where the air molecules are ionized by the passage of the meteor. Such ionization trails can last up to 45 minutes at a time.<div><br></div><div>Small, sand-grain sized meteoroids are entering the atmosphere constantly, essentially every few seconds in any given region of the atmosphere, and thus ionization trails can be found in the upper atmosphere more or less continuously. When radio waves are bounced off these trails, it is called meteor burst communications. Meteor radars can measure atmospheric density and winds by measuring the decay rate and Doppler shift of a meteor trail. Most meteoroids burn up when they enter the atmosphere. The left-over debris is called meteoric dust or just meteor dust. Meteor dust particles can persist in the atmosphere for up to several months. These particles might affect climate, both by scattering electromagnetic radiation and by catalyzing chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere.[44] Meteoroids or their fragments may achieve dark flight after deceleration to terminal velocity.[45] Dark flight starts when they decelerate to about 2–4 km/s (4,500–8,900 mph).[46] Larger fragments will fall further down the strewn field.</div><div>The visible light produced by a meteor may take on various hues, depending on the chemical composition of the meteoroid, and the speed of its movement through the atmosphere. As layers of the meteoroid abrade and ionize, the colour of the light emitted may change according to the layering of minerals. Colours of meteors depend on the relative influence of the metallic content of the meteoroid versus the superheated air plasma, which its passage engenders:[47]</div><div><br></div><div>Orange-yellow (sodium)</div><div>Yellow (iron)</div><div>Blue-green (magnesium)</div><div>Violet (calcium)</div><div>Red (atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen)</div><div>A meteor shower is the result of an interaction between a planet, such as Earth, and streams of debris from a comet or other source. The passage of Earth through cosmic debris from comets and other sources is a recurring event in many cases. Comets can produce debris by water vapor drag, as demonstrated by Fred Whipple in 1951,[58] and by breakup. Each time a comet swings by the Sun in its orbit, some of its ice vaporizes and a certain amount of meteoroids will be shed. The meteoroids spread out along the entire orbit of the comet to form a meteoroid stream, also known as a "dust trail" (as opposed to a comet's "dust tail" caused by the very small particles that are quickly blown away by solar radiation pressure).</div><div><br></div><div>The frequency of fireball sightings increases by about 10–30% during the weeks of vernal equinox.[59] Even meteorite falls are more common during the northern hemisphere's spring season. Although this phenomenon has been known for quite some time, the reason behind the anomaly is not fully understood by scientists. Some researchers attribute this to an intrinsic variation in the meteoroid population along Earth's orbit, with a peak in big fireball-producing debris around spring and early summer. Others have pointed out that during this period the ecliptic is (in the northern hemisphere) high in the sky in the late afternoon and early evening. This means that fireball radiants with an asteroidal source are high in the sky (facilitating relatively high rates) at the moment the meteoroids "catch up" with Earth, coming from behind going in the same direction as Earth. This causes relatively low relative speeds and from this low entry speeds, which facilitates survival of meteorites.[60] It also generates high fireball rates in the early evening, increasing chances of eyewitness reports. This explains a part, but perhaps not all of the seasonal variation. Research is in progress for mapping the orbits of the meteors to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon.</div></div><label style="margin: 0px; line-height: 1; overflow: hidden; overflow-wrap: break-word; max-width: 320px; border-style: solid; text-rendering: optimizespeed; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-radius: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; padding: 2px 15px; width: 260px; height: 65px; position: absolute; left: 25px; top: 0px; font-size: 30px;" id="label17">METEOROIDS</label></div><div class="screen" tabindex="1" data-theme="default" id="howtouse" style="height: 450px; width: 320px; left: 0px; top: 0px; position: absolute; z-index: 0; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); display: none;"><button id="button8" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border-style: solid; height: 55px; width: 320px; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-color: rgb(77, 87, 95); font-family: &quot;Arial Black&quot;, Gadget, sans-serif; position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 395px; border-radius: 100px; font-size: 30px; border-width: 0px;">BACK</button><div contenteditable="true" class="textArea" id="text_area6" style="width: 320px; height: 395px; border-style: solid; background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); color: rgb(77, 87, 95); border-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-radius: 2px; border-width: 1px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; padding: 5px 15px; position: absolute; left: 4.44089e-16px; top: 4.44089e-16px; margin: 0px; font-size: 30px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;HOW TO USE<div><br></div><div>1) &nbsp;If you want to know about the space objects you can click on them and know about it.</div><div><br></div><div>2)If you have understand the topic you can put a tick on the box given above it.</div><div><br></div><div> YOU CAN PRESS THE BACK BUTTON TO GO BACK &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THANK YOU</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div></div></div>
